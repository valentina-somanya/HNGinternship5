            <p>The time is here! Many of you have been asking on slack when our group projects / open source projects will begin.</p>

<p><strong>Well, today is the start of something amazing with our community of 4,000 students:</strong>

You can now <strong>join open source projects created by you</strong>, and then <strong>work with fellow students to build the next app or startup</strong>. Why would you want to do this?</p>



<ol><li>Working in teams with fellow students will prepare you for the job market where you will be working with others using Github. </li><li> You can expand your portfolio by adding projects you have worked on with others. </li><li> You contribute to open source.</li><li> On your resume, you will be able to showcase that you started an open source project and self organized with your fellow students. I don't know about you, but I would hire someone who shows initiative like that :). </li></ol>



<p><strong>So how do you get started?<br><br>*** Don't worry, there is a section "Git + Github + Open Source Projects" where I take you through a step by step video on how to contribute to open source projects so you can come back to this then.***<br></strong></p>



<p>1. Join our slack community and make sure you are in the #group-project channel. </p>



<p>2. Head on over to this link where you will find <a href="https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the 5 step guide to get started</a>.</p>



<p>3. Stat contributing to open source projects in our new community: <a href="https://github.com/zero-to-mastery" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/zero-to-mastery</a></p>



<p>I would like to thank <strong>@Caleb, @Wan, @Samir, @Abdus, @Sheel</strong>, and <strong>@Dan</strong> who are your fellow students and will be taking on the role of administrators. Send them a message to thank them for their efforts :)</p>



<p>Ps, the administrators created this website in about a week of just working together: <a href="https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/zero-to-mastery-website" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/zero-to-mastery-website</a></p>



<p><strong>Imagine what we can build with thousands in the community :). This is for EVERYONE. You don't need to complete the course to contribute. You should start today! We will be an inclusive community and no matter your experience, you can participate with any sort of contribution. Check out <a href="https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines/blob/master/Get%20Started.md" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">code of conduct</a>. </strong></p>



<p>
I am very excited about this and I hope you are to. This could turn into something big. Enjoy, and see you in the #group-project channel!</p>
